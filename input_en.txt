After a long and challenging seminar on economic theories and hours spent in the university library trying to complete a complicated project, Andreea headed back to the student dormitory. In front of the door, her best friend, Maria, was waiting for her with a warm smile and two steaming cups of coffee. The two sat down on the old armchair in the room, a thick blanket draped over their knees, chatting about dreams, exams, and plans for the future. As their laughter filled the room, outside, the moon shone timidly through scattered clouds, and the city's noise gradually faded, promising a night full of peaceful thoughts and genuine friendship.
